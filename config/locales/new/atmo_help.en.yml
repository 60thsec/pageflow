This feature lets you add background audio to every page regardless of its page type.
You can define if a sound should play only for one page or continue playing for more pages without interruption.
Simply select the same atmo audio file for some adjacent pages.


That way chapters can be seperated acoustically
and pages that belong together can be weaved to a stronger unit.


For the page type „Video“ there is a special option
to pause background audio or continue at lower volume while the video is playing.


You find the atmo settings on the „Options“ tab of each page.


Should you ever feel distracted by the atmo audio while working on your entry,
you can use the hot key „Alt + a“ to temporarily mute it.
Simply press „Alt + a“ again to reactivate atmo audio.
