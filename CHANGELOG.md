# CHANGELOG

### Changes on `master`

None so far.

### Version 0.3.0

##### Breaking Changes

- Requiring `pageflow/seeds` in your `db/seeds.rb` file no longer
  automatically creates database records. Instead, you can include the
  `Pageflow::Seeds` module to configure your database seed via a DSL.
  ([#73](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/pull/73))

  To keep seeding your database with the same default users and sample
  entry as before, re-running the `pagflow:seeds` generator and choose
  to overwrite your your `db/seeds.rb` file:

      $ cd your_pageflow_app/
      $ rails generate pageflow:seeds

- DOM change: `.navigation a.navigation_home` has been renamed to
  `.navigation a.navigation_top`. You need to update corresponding
  selectors inside custom themes. Instead, a new `.navigation
  a.navigation_home` button is now supported, which links to a
  configurable external site.
  ([#98](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/pull/98))

  If you do not wish to use this new home button with your custom
  theme, you can disable it when registering themes in your
  `config/initializers/pageflow.rb`:

      config.themes.register(:custom, no_home_button: true)

  This will cause Pageflow to only render the `a.navigation_top` link
  in entries using your theme.

### Version 0.2.1

- Update Zencoder gem to fix [Zencoder SSL issue](http://status.zencoder.com/events/84) ([#70](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/pull/70)).

### Version 0.2.0

##### Breaking Changes

- Themes have been splitted in Themes and Themings. Themings
  exist per account in the database containing configuration like
  copyright/imprint link urls and reference a theme. Themes represent
  available CSS and correspond directly to directories under
  `pageflow/themes`. Themes are registered in the Pageflow
  initializer.
  ([#45](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/pull/45))

  To update your application:

  * Add the following line to your `config/initializers/pageflow.rb`:

          config.themes.register(:default)

  * Install and run the migrations to convert your database.

##### Public Site

  entries available under a certain host name.
  ([#61](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/pull/61))

##### Internals

- Tests now use MySQL.
  The dummy application used to test the Pageflow Gem against now uses MySQL.
  To run the testsuite you need to have a MySQL database called `pageflow_dummy_test`
  You can configure user and password by setting the environment variables
  `PAGEFLOW_DB_USER` and `PAGEFLOW_DB_PASSWORD`. If they are not present `root` is
  assumed as user and the password is left blank.
  ([#56](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/pull/56))
- The Accounts admin show template has been splitted into multiple
  partials.
  ([#65](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/pull/65))
